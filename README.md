# Potterpedia-1

The Potterpedia project emerged within the UC of Dynamic Technologies for the Internet (TDI), and went through two versions to meet the two challenges posed.

In the first stage, it was intended to create a project that used at least one external API and was developed in React.js. So, I chose to use two different APIs to complement the information I needed: the Potter API and the HP-API. For the design implementation, I chose to use Reactstrap together with Bootstrap, also using Styled Components. Besides that, it was also necessary to use CSS for some specific cases. To return the data coming from the APIS I also used Redux. I consider important to mention that one of the APIS is no longer supported and that can be observed in the first video (when the error message appears).
